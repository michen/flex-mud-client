<h2>Regexp Reminder</h2>

<p>
. = matches anything<br>
\w = word chars (a-z, A-Z or 0-9)<br>
\d = any digit<br>
\s = white space<br>
^ = start of the line<br>
$ = end of the line<br>
\ = escapes special characters i.e. ( ) . [ ] | ^ $ etc etc<br>
</p>

<p>
* = previous thing repeated 0 or more times<br>
+ = previos thing repeated 1 or more times<br>
? = previous thing repeated 0 or 1 times<br>
{x} = previous thing repeated x times<br>
{x,} = previous thing repeated x or more times<br>
{x,y} = previous thing repeated x to y times<br>
</p>

<p>
| = or i.e cat|dog = cat or dog<br>
() = group things togeather i.e c(at|og) matches cat or cog. also anything inside a match is returned (can be used via %1 .. %n)<br>
[] = defines a character class to match. i.e [aeiou] will match any vowel. you can also use ranges with a hyphen eg. [0-9]<br>
</p>

<h2>Triggers</h2>
<p>
If you grouping in your pattern you can use the resulting match in your command<br>

i.e  pattern : ^grexil orders you to '(.*)'$<br> 
matches: grexil orders you to 'scrub the floors'<br>
%1 = scrub the floors<br>
command: say no way will I %1 <br>
produces: "say no way will I scrub the floors"<br>
</p>

<h2>Aliases</h2>
<p>
An alias matches the first word you enter in a command. any additional words are taken as parameters<br>
i.e an alias for 'peer' will match "peer grexil" but not "grexil peer" etc.<br>
in the command you can use the parameters via %1 .. %n<br>
i.e if your command is "emote peers at %1 warily" then "peer grexil" would be converted to "emote peers at grexil warily"<br>
</p>

<h2>Functions</h2>
There are a few functions that have been implemented. User defined functions can be created via aliases...
Parameters to functions must be comma seperated and can either be:<br>
<li>A quoted string. eg 'grexil'</li> 
<li>A number. i.e. 3.14</li>
<li>A variable name. eg x</li>
<li>Another function eg. add(2,3)</li>
Functions can be used in two ways...<br>
<h3>As a command</h3>
<p>
if a command starts with a / it is interperated as a function. i.e /set('x',3) sets the variable x to 3.<br>
</p>
<h3>Inline</h3>
<p>
a function can be placed inline in a command by putting it inside %(). i.e %(get('x')) will get the value of the variable x.<br>
e.g. command: "I have %(add(x,2)) apples" would produce "I have 5 apples" if x was set to 3.<br>
</p>
<h3>Aliases as functions</h3>
<p>
Aliases can be treated as functions.<br>
i.e the peer alias above could be used either via "/peer('grexil')" or inline as "%(peer('grexil'))" tho in this case the inline use probably wouldn't be so useful.<br>
